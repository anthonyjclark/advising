**Advising**
 [Dr. Anthony J. Clark](http://anthonyjclark.com)

This is a pretty long document that can serve as a one-stop shop for all advising related activities. You might find it useful to search the page for something in-specific. For example, if you don't know what computer scientists do, you might search the page for "jobs."

One last note: **I am an important part of your Pomona College experience**, you should plan on meeting with me to discuss classes, careers, and any troubles you might be having (academic or otherwise).

Here are some quick highlights about me:
- You can call me "Prof Clark" (I also don't mind Dr. Clark or Tony). This is somewhat of a convention on campus, you'll almost never go wrong with "Prof Surname" when referring to your instructors.
- I am originally from the Kansas City area.
- I have a Bachelor of Science (BS) in Computer Engineering from Kansas State University.
- I have a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Computer Science from Michigan State University.
- [I work with students to build small, robust autonomous robots](http://anthonyjclark.com/arcs-lab/).

Directions
===============================================================================

My office is Edmunds Hall 127. Here is how you get to my office from the main entrance to [Edmunds Hall](https://www.pomona.edu/map/?id=523#!m/54434) (facing north from the south side of the building off of 6th Street).

![Directions to My Office](resources/directions-to-office.mp4)



Before We Meet
===============================================================================

Generally, you do not need to contact me before stopping by my office. You should feel free to stop by and chat about anything at any time. However, if you'd like to get **released to register** for the next semester, I'd like you to do a little prep work before we meet:

- Send me an email or Slack message to setup a time to meet (we'll need about 30 minutes). See [How to Email Your Professor (without being annoying AF)](https://medium.com/@lportwoodstacer/how-to-email-your-professor-without-being-annoying-af-cf64ae0e4087).
- Come to my office prepared with questions and/or topics to discuss.
- Come to my office with a list of courses that you are considering (including one or two backup options).

You don't need to have your schedule planned out, but it will help me get an idea for what you'd like to take. Here are some other general tips:

- I prefer face-to-face meetings the first couple of times we discuss your schedules.
- If you know your schedule or have a quick question, then we can discuss via email.
- To make an appointment send me an email with a couple of days notice and with a few of your preferred meeting times.
- Let me know if you are going to be more than 10 minutes late and we can reschedule.

It might seem like a small things, but I highly recommend [**setting-up Outlook email on your phone**](https://w2.outlook.com/l/mobile?WT.mc_id=Outlook_Front_Door). Almost all communication on campus will be via email, and some of it will be very time sensitive (for example, a canceled class, meeting, or office hours).



Advising Meetings
===============================================================================

We will use most of our meeting time to discuss your course schedule for the next semester (or whatever else you have on your mind). I'll usually ask you the following question:

- Why computer science?
- What other majors did you consider and why?
- What courses are you thinking about taking next semester?

## Getting an Advisor Release Over Email

While it is not my preferred method, if you are organized we can always complete an advising meeting by email. I expect you to send me your proposed schedule as well as a few backup courses. You can try-out [Hyperschedule](https://hyperschedule.io/ "Hyperschedule - The fast course scheduler") (or the slightly newer [5cscheduler](view-source:https://www.5scheduler.io/)) and show me what you've come up with.

## Registration Process

- Search for courses on my.pomona (you can search by discipline and area, searching by course number or title is less useful)
- Meet with advisor
- Add/register/enroll and drop courses using my.pomona
- First-year students take ID 001
- Transfer students may take up to 6 course credits, but only 4.75 can be registered prior to the first day of class.
- If you are logged-in, you will see eligibility (open/closed, enrollment requirements) information.

**On my end, I need to grant your registration clearance.**

## Registration Time-line

Here is a rough time-line for a single academic year starting in the fall.

- Prior Spring
    - current student advising window for fall
    - current student pre-pre-enrollment for fall
    - current student pre-enrollment for fall
- Summer
    - incoming student pre-enrollment orientation
    - incoming student advising window for fall
    - incoming student pre-enrollment for fall
    - incoming student move-in (some move in early)
- Fall
    - instructors consider PERM lists
    - classes start and enrollment reopens
    - enrollment ends of the second week
    - drop and grading option deadlines (check calendar)
    - student advising window for spring
    - student pre-pre-enrollment for spring
    - student pre-enrollment for spring
- Spring
    - instructors consider PERM lists
    - classes start and enrollment reopens
    - enrollment ends of the second week
    - drop and grading option deadlines (check calendar)
    - process continues for next academic year

(Note: this doesn't include students starting in a spring term.)

## Course Load

- Four one-credit courses for eight semesters (32 total credits).
- Minimum full-time course load is three.
- First-semester students cannot exceed 4.75 courses (unless one or more courses is a half-credit course, then the maximum is 5.25).
- Second-semester students who complete the first semester with a B may enroll in 6 courses (otherwise the limit from the first semester carries over).
- All other students may enroll in a maximum of 6 courses.

## Pre-Enrollment

Students are limited to 4 full courses during pre-enrollment. Other courses may be added at the start of the semester.

## PERMs (Permission to Register)

- Submit a PERM if the course is full, you don't meet the course requirements, or if the course is by PERM only.
- You can still only register during your add period.
- You are **not** automatically registered in course.
- You'll need to wait for a response from the instructor.

<!-- TODO: PERM flowchart? -->

## General Planning Advice

These are not requirements, but they are good ideas in general.

- Consider internship opportunities each summer (even your first summer).
- Consider research opportunities every semester and summer.
- First year
    + complete at least three of the six breadth of study requirements
    + complete a physical education course
    + explore fields that were not available to you in high school
    + balance your topics
- Second year
    + declare your major
- Third year
    + consider career options
    + consider graduate/medical/business school
    + consider a senior thesis
- 11 courses in major; 21 courses for experimentation (relax and take chances)

## Pass/No Credit (P/NC)

First-year students and sophomores may take three courses on the Pass/No credit grading option per year; juniors and seniors have unlimited P/NC options outside their major.  Students may take courses for Gen Ed requirements on a Pass/No Credit basis.  However, most departments require that courses for the major be taken on a letter-grade basis.

## Independent Study Limits

Students may enroll in one Independent Study course per semester for the first and sophomore years, and two per semester in the junior and senior years, with the permission of the instructor and advisor.

## Cross-Enrollment

Note: While students may cross-enroll in areas that Pomona does not offer courses, they must complete a Pomona major.

- First-year students may cross-enroll for one course each semester.
- Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may cross-enroll for 40% of their overall program. Normally this will mean that the student will not cross-enroll for more than 10 of the 24 courses taken in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years.
- Exceptions to the rules above are contingent on advisor approval.



Advising FAQs
===============================================================================

My advisor hasn't cleared me, what should I do?
: Reach out to your advisor as soon as possible.

I am trying to add a 5th course, how do I get approval?
: Students are limited to pre-enrollment in four full courses (4.0 credits) and .75 course credits from partial credit courses. Additional courses may be added, subject to the student's eligibility; at the start of the semester.

The portal won't allow me to add or drop courses; it says I have a hold. What should I do?
: Determine what type of hold is on your account, and then contact the department associated with your hold (and your advisor).

My PERM was just approved, but my registration appointment is over, how can I add the course?
: Once Add/Drop reopens on the first day of classes, you will be able to add the course.

Can I complete a major from one of the other colleges?
: No. Though you do have the option to propose a special major.

Can I take my breadth areas, overlays and/or language requirement courses as Pass/No Credit?
: Yes.

What's the minimum grade to satisfy a General Education (GE) Requirement?
: D- or P (Pass).

I'm not seeing my AP exams on my transcript, what should I do?
: Contact admissions and ask if they received your scores from College Board.

Can AP exam credits satisfy Breadth requirements?
: No. But a score of 4-5 on an AP (or 6-7 on an IB) language exam may satisfy the foreign language requirement.



Computer Science Requirements
===============================================================================

CS FAQs
===============================================================================

What is the difference between *Computer Science (CS)*, *Management and Information Systems* (computer information systems (IS), information technology (IT)), *Computer Engineering*, and *Data Science (DS)*?
: To put it simply: <u>computer scientists</u> study programming, theory, and methods for developing large programs; <u>information technology personnel</u> focus more on business, using software as a tool, and making decisions on computer hardware (specs, prices, etc.); <u>computer engineers</u> work more on *low-level* software that interacts directly with hardware (sometimes called embedded systems, like writing a driver for a new USB device so that it can talk to the operating system); and <u>data scientists</u> work in interdisciplinary teams try to model processes or discover useful patterns in data (these techniques often involve "big data," artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, or neural networks (deep learning)). See [this discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/anr40s/eli5_whats_the_difference_between_cs_computer/) for more information.


What is the difference between *Computer Science* at Pomona College (a liberal arts college) and Computer Science at a research university?
: The biggest difference is in the number of required CS courses. You are required to take 11 CS courses here at Pomona, but at a state school, [like UCLA](https://www.seasoasa.ucla.edu/curric-20-21/83-compsci-cur20.html), you might be required to take closer to 18 CS courses. Our department tends to combine a few subject areas, such digital logic, networking, and operating systems, so that you end up seeing a similar breadth of topics but perhaps less depth in some areas.


What kind of jobs (careers) do computer science students get?
: Computer scientists are in-demand around the country. Most of our students end up with the title *Software Engineer*, which means they spend their time designing, programming, and debugging large pieces of software. CS students might also look for careers in academia or data science. I am happy to chat with you about all of your options!

<!-- salaries, companies, success rates for department -->


How do I get involved in computer science on campus and Southern California?
: See section Getting Involved.


What programming languages should I know?
: There is no correct answer here, but I'd recommend learning the following (over the course of many years): a general-purpose **scripting** language (e.g., Python, Ruby, maybe Bash), a compiled **systems** language (e.g., C, C++, Rust, Zig), a **JVM** language (e.g., Java, Kotlin, Scala, Clojure), a **web** programming language (e.g., JavaScript, TypeScript), a **Lisp-y** language (e.g., Common Lisp, Racket, Scheme, Clojure), an object-oriented programming (**OOP**) language (e.g., Java, C#, Smalltalk), a **functional** programming language (e.g., Haskell, SML, F#, Erlang), a logic programming language (e.g., Prolog), and an **array** language (e.g., APL, J, Q, K). You can find some languages that overlap several areas. For example, C++ is a systems OOP language and Scala is a functional JVM language. The more important question is answered next.


How do I learn a new programming language?
: It is best to start with a project idea in mind. It is needlessly difficult to learn a language without having something to drive your interest. I recommend coming up with a project idea ([building a game in Python](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/), [creating a resume website on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site), [creating a programming language](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/), [writing a ray tracer](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), playing with an [Arduino](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/tags/beginner) or [Raspberry Pi](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en) etc.) and then picking a new programming language to fit your project. I am happy to give advice on where to start.


How can I get help with writing, math, interviewing, finances, etc?
: See section Resources.


Can I test-out of (not have to take) the first CS course (CS 51)?
: Yes, you should speak with your advisor about your programming background, which might include a high school AP course, work experience, or self-study. Students occasionally skip CS 51.



General Education
===============================================================================

> "Breadth of Study Area Requirements: Thirty-two course credits or the equivalent are required to graduate. Courses taken to satisfy General Education requirements may be taken for letter grade or on a Pass/No Credit (P/NC) grading basis. No two breadth areas can be fulfilled with only courses from the same department or program. Once matriculated, Breadth of Study requirements can only be satisfied with courses taken in residence at The Claremont Colleges. Courses taken abroad or on other external programs do not satisfy area requirements."
>
>      -- [General Education Requirements Handout (PDF)](https://my.pomona.edu/ICSFileServer/FacultyForms/GE%20requirements%20handout.pdf)

You must satisfy:

1. The six breadth areas. One course in each of these areas:

	+ Area 1: Criticism, Analysis, and Contextual Study of Works of the Human Imagination
	+ Area 2: Social Institutions and Human  Behavior
	+ Area 3: History, Values, Ethics and Cultural Studies
	+ Area 4: Physical and Biological Sciences
	+ Area 5: Mathematical and Formal Reasoning
	+ Area 6: Creation and Performance of Works of Art and Literature

2. The physical education requirement of completing two activities.

3. The language requirement, which can be satisfied in many ways.

4. The overlay requirements:

	+ One writing intensive course
	+ One speaking intensive course
	+ Analyzing difference

Other information:

- Some courses can satisfy breadth area and overlay requirements, but the same course can never satisfy both the writing and speaking intensives.
- You can take courses for letter grade or on a Pass/No Credit (P/NC) basis.
- You cannot fulfill two breadth areas with courses from the same department or program.
- Must be satisfied by courses taken in residence at The Claremont Colleges.

See the [General Education Requirements Handout (PDF)](https://my.pomona.edu/ICSFileServer/FacultyForms/GE%20requirements%20handout.pdf) for more information.




Being "Successful"
===============================================================================

*Disclaimer: this section includes my advice and opinions.*

If you want to be a "successful" student (for whatever you might have as your personal definition of success), I think you must start with **metacognition**. Metacognition is an awareness or analysis of your own learning or thinking processes. Essentially, you should commit to thinking about how you are thinking.

- Are you reading/watching without understanding (do you find yourself needing to reread paragraphs of text or rewatch sections of videos)?

- Do you recognize when you don't understand something?

- Are you being lazy while learning? We all often assume that we understand something and convince ourselves not to think deeply, complete practice problems, or engage with optional critical thinking tasks.

Even if you are not currently metacognitive, the great thing is that it is a skill that you can learn (like anything else).

Here is one method to get started with metacognition. Start taking learning notes by answering these question on a weekly basis:

- What do I think I was supposed to learn this week?
    + You can this compare these topics to the readings, assignments, and syllabi.

- What was easiest for me to learn this week? Why?

- What was most challenging for me to learn? Why?

- What study strategies worked well as I prepared for my exam?

- What strategies for exam preparation didn't work well?

- What will I do differently next time?

A few things to consider:

- Teach a subject to a peer or TA (and take turns doing so).
- Create your own test/exam questions at the (apply/analyze/evaluate level of [Bloom's](https://www.bloomstaxonomy.net/)).
- Use [Pomodoro task management](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bryancollinseurope/2020/03/03/the-pomodoro-technique/)
- Be [deliberate](https://jamesclear.com/deliberate-practice-theory) when learning
- [Interleave](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2016/8/11-1) study topics
- Try to maintain a [growth mindset](https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-having-a-growth-mindset-actually-means)
- Try using [temptation bundling](https://jamesclear.com/temptation-bundling)
- Consider using [Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/getting-started.html) as a flashcard app
- [Take notes by hand and not on a keyboard](https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/sites.udel.edu/dist/6/132/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf)
- Jot down notes in your own words, don't just copy what was said or seen
- [Study Less, Study Smart](https://medschoolinsiders.com/pre-med/study-less-study-smart-what-i-wish-i-knew-in-college/)
- Review your notes the next day, not just when an exam approaches
- Start homework when it is assigned
- Put study time on your calendar (use your calendar effectively)
- Maintain a writing schedule (write 30 minutes every day)
- No TV while studying
- No music with lyrics while studying
- Complete homework without Googling
- Never be afraid to fail
- Failing is part of learning
- Try to fail better each time
- Criticism is part of learning
- Don’t concern yourself with others
- Create your own practice questions
- Stay positive

Graduate School
===============================================================================

Pursuing a Master's or PhD is quite a bit different than pursing a job. Though, getting a Master's is not much different than the process you went through to get your undergraduate degree, so I am going to focus on PhDs here.

Here is the basic process:

- Find undergraduate research experiences (research experience for undergraduates (REUs), independent research projects, research with faculty, work in a government research lab, etc.).
- Take the [the GRE general test](https://www.ets.org/gre) (similar to the ACT/SAT) before your senior year. (Note: this might not always be necessary anymore.)
- Search for PhD **advisors** before you start applying. Your choice of advisor is vastly more important than your choice of school.
- Contact potential advisors.
- Apply to research universities the fall of your senior year.

For finding an advisor, I recommend:

1. Searching for research papers ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) work well) that cover topics in which you are interested. Look for papers that were published in the last few years.
2. Contact authors that are current faculty members (the first author is often a PhD student--so keep an eye out for faculty members in the author lists). When you contact faculty members you should not be pushy, but you should offer to send them descriptions of your undergraduate research and your resume. This should be done early during the fall semester of your senior year (assuming you want to start grad school the following fall).

Students often think they need to complete a Master's before they look for PhD programs. However, many faculty members prefer you to get your Master's with them too. This gives them an extended period of time to work with you before they need to commit to funding your through a PhD. Basically, if you don't work well with the advisor you can leave with your Master's and look for someone else to guide you through a PhD.

Resources:

- [Applying to Graduate School](https://careers.umbc.edu/students/gradschool/)
- [Computer Science Undergraduate Research: Grad School](https://conquer.cra.org/students)
- [The illustrated guide to a Ph.D.](http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/)
- [Preparing a Graduate School Application & Contacting Potential Supervisors](https://youtu.be/B3oANa67Iq4)

Some general notes:

- PhD vs Master's
    + PhD: research focused; paths into the academy (teaching and/or research) and research labs; more like a job you'll have for 4-6 years than school.
    + Master's: professional focused; more like your undergrad program (2 years or so) but with more of an emphasis in one area of advanced computer science.
    + Perspective form a PhD advisor: a PhD student is more likely going to work for several years and produce results, so a PhD student is more likely to receive a research assistantship.
    + You can always plan on a PhD and leave earlier with a Master's if you find it not to your liking.
- Funding
    + Never pay for grad school in CS.
    + You can apply for fellowships and fund yourself (for example, [[https://www.nsfgrfp.org/][An NSF GRFP]]). You're likely to get to go anywhere you'd like if you come in with a GRFP. Many universities also offer fellowships that are not tied to a specific research lab.
    + You can receive a research assistantship from a faculty member.
    + You can work for a department as a teaching assistant.
    + Your employer might pay for your Master's if you agree to work for some number of years.
- Where to apply
    + Find a place doing the work you want to do.
    + Find an advisor whose values (e.g., work/life balance, broad vs narrow focus) line up with yours.
        * Style of advising is important too.
        * Speak to current students about the lab environment.
    + One benefit of getting a graduate degree is that you can try-out one or two new places to live.
    + Look for advisors working in a specific area of your interests (look for research papers on the web).
- Life as a grad student
    + The pay is lousy (25-30k/yr).
    + Benefits are OK (health, sometimes childcare, sometimes cheap housing)
    + Can be very uncertain (am I working on the right thing? Am I doing it the right way?), so have to be comfortable with being uncomfortable.
    + You are paid to do research and/or to TA courses. This can mean
        * teaching lectures or small discussion sections,
        * grading and holding office hours, and/or
        * acting as an "instructor of record" for a course.
    + You will probably get to travel on a yearly basis.
    + Speak with current grad students to get a better idea.
- Applying and getting accepted
    + Have a CV as part of your application, website are typically less important.
    + Make it clear about why you're applying to this place in particular.
    + Personal connection (even by email) with advisor or current students very effective.
    + Ask for recommendations some time in advance.
        * Provide an outline of the main things your recommender knows about you and that you want them to highlight in your application. [Here are my requirements](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc//reference/).
    + An REU (research experience for undergrads) can show you are serious about research.
        * Find REU opportunities [here](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) or [here](https://reufinder.com/).
- Going from industry to academia
    + It is not common to go from industry to academia, but mainly because
        * it is a **big** pay-cut, and
        * you'd need to move your family to a new location.
    + Generally, universities and faculty like perspective students with industry experience. They come in with more programming skills, they are more mature, and they have definite reasons for committing to academia.


Getting a Job
===============================================================================

You should start by answering the following question for yourself: *What are your career goals?*. Do you want to work in web development? Do you want to start your own company? Do you want to work for a large or famous tech company? Do you want to build video games? Does *data science* sound like it would be a good fit? It is useful to have some idea about what you want out of your computer science career.

Here are my recommendations:

- Get involved in student groups (section Getting Involved).
- Get involved in off-campus activities (section Getting Involved).
- Consider working on an independent research project (for course credit or not).
- Start working on your computer science *profile* early.
- Build [your resume](https://www.pomona.edu/sites/default/files/cdo_resource_guide.pdf) early.

**Computer science profile**: when looking for computer science jobs, it can be important to demonstrate that you can (a) learn new technologies, (b) develop a medium sized piece of software (something bigger than your class projects), and (c) communicate with collaborators and users. The easiest way to do this is to develop your portfolio of coding projects.

I recommend creating a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account (or BitBucket or GitLab, or etc.), and then creating a simple website that describes your varying projects. You can then put a link to that website on your resume. This will enable you to highlight which projects you want employers to view. Make sure you have design documents, good documentation, and good follow-through (don't exclusively have abandoned projects). Turning your resume into a webpage can be a great way to get started.

Many large companies have program specifically targeted at first and second year computer science students. Here are some:

- Microsoft Explore
- Facebook University
- Google STEP
- Twitter Academy

: In general these terms are used almost interchangeably. *Universities* are large institutions with many varied degree offerings; universities often comprise many *colleges* or *schools* (e.g., Michigan State University has colleges of engineering, education, etc., and the engineering college comprises many departments). *Colleges* are similar but often with a smaller variety of degree options. *Institutes* typically have a focus area (e.g., an institute of technology will have mostly confer science and engineering degrees). Most higher-ed (anything after high school) *academies* are synonymous with universities.

Divisions
: Pomona College is split into three academic divisions: Humanities (Division I), Natural Sciences (Division II), and Social Sciences (Division III).


Liberal Arts
: Academic areas including natural sciences, social sciences, arts, and humanities.


Liberal Arts College (LAC)
: A college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts. LAC students typically see a broader range of subjects (and less content in their degree area) than those at public universities.


PhD
: Most faculty members have *Doctorates of Philosophy* (abbreviated PhD). This does not mean that they have a doctorate **in** philosophy. It is just a title. For example, I have a Doctorate of Philosophy in Computer Science from a Computer Science department.


Assistant/Associate/Full/Visiting/Adjunct Professor, Lecturer, and Instructor
: Some of your teachers will have teaching, service, and research duties. These instructors are typically tenure-track or tenured faculty. You can expect them to be at the college for a long time (sometimes most or all of their career). These faculty start out as *assistant* professors and then move on to *associate* and finally *full* professors as they fulfill certain conditions. Some instructors will have similar duties but shorter-term appointments and will be given the titles visiting or adjunct professor. Finally, some of your teachers will have reduced research requirements and longer term appointments, and they often have titles like *lecturer* or *instructor*. You can safely refer to all assistant/associate/full/adjunct/visiting professors, lectures, and instructors as "Prof Surname."


Teacher vs Professor
: Teachers are trained experts in teaching, whereas your professors are trained experts in some field (for example, computer science).


Office Hours
: Your course instructors will always have office hours available. These are times that they expect students to come by and discuss course-related material.


Prerequisites
: Some courses require you to complete another course before you can register.


College Leadership (Board of Trustees, President, and Deans)
: https://www.pomona.edu/about/college-leadership


Semesters
: Most college classes are only one semester in duration. Unlike high school, when you come back after the winter break, you will be in a completely new set of classes.


Bachelor of Science (BS) or Bachelor of Arts (BA)
: BAs typically require fewer major-specific courses (and additional non-major requirements), but otherwise these two degree types are pretty similar.

Closing Remarks
===============================================================================

Your computer science degree is **not** about preparing you for all (or any really) possible pieces of technology that you will see once you start your career after graduation. In fact, we expect you to have to do a lot of learning once you leave us.

What we want to do is teach you how to learn new ideas, concepts, technologies, and languages.
